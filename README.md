# Angular2 Simple Starter

A Starter for angular which I think it ok for starting a project

#### Why not directly use `@angular/cli`

Yes, @angular/cli is awesome, which is good for start a angular project. But sometimes, default configrations are not always suitable for project. Although @angular/cli can eject webpack configration, but I think is a lot complex to modify, so here the Starter.

TODO
- [] complete lint configration
- [] upgrade webpack to 3
- [] use starter write a todo mvc demo
- [] add simple test for starter for good to start
