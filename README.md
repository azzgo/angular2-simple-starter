# Angular2 Simple Starter

A Starter for angular which I think it ok for starting a project

Dev Mode server default run on Port 9000

#### Why not directly use `@angular/cli`

Yes, @angular/cli is awesome, which is good for start a angular project. But sometimes, default configrations are not always suitable for project. Although @angular/cli can eject webpack configration, but I think is a lot complex to modify, so here the Starter.


#### Notice

1. Before you run e2e test, you should update your webdriver-manager, you can run `npm run pre-e2e`. Because this command is a little slow, so i am not put it as pree2e
